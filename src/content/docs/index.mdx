## Is this docs what you want?

Since late 2024, we have been actively developing a new system to replace the legacy one used since 2021.
Although some information here apply to both systems, it is written with a focus on the new system.

If you are looking for info on the legacy system and is a CUHK Robocon Team member, refer to the _Zero to Hero_, ask seniors for the document.
For others, unfortunately, it is not a public document. 
For us, unfortunately, we also forgot to restrict Github write access, which explains why UST robotics team members can edit on this document.

<Aside type="caution">
I need to restate that this docs is written entirely by students.
It is best not to depend your life on it.
In case you are uncertain or something is not stated explicitly, ask someone that knows their shit.

## Structure & Purposes

In this docs, the groups in the navbar e.g. _VESC 6_, _Did I ask?_ are called **topic**s.
Under those topics are **chapter**s, e.g. _Getting started_, _Introduction to VESC 6_, where contents actually live.

This docs serves two purposes: gives you instructions on how to make things work, and leaves useful info for future maintainers and contributors.

Most of the content will be on how to make things work in the form of step-by-step guides.

If you are a super nerd and would like to work on very low-level stuff/libraries, probably check out the [Did I ask?](/docs/did-i-ask/welcome) topic.
