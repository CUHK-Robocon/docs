## Is this docs what you want?

Since late 2024, we have been actively developing a new system to replace the legacy one used since 2021.
Although some information here apply to both systems, it is written with a focus on the new system.

If you are looking for info on the legacy system and is a CUHK Robocon Team member, refer to the _Zero to Hero_, ask seniors for the document.
For others, unfortunately, it is not a public document.

<Aside type="caution">
I need to restate that this docs is written entirely by students.
It is best not to depend your life on it.
In case you are uncertain or something is not stated explicitly, ask someone that knows their shit.
