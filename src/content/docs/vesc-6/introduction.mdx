<Aside type="danger">
Regardless of whether you are a core or a new member, you **MUST** consult senior members if this is the first time you work with a VESC.

If you forgot any step, **DO NOT** attempt blindly, check the docs again.
If there are details unspecified in the docs, e.g. unseen buttons or pop-up warnings, ask someone who may know or make sure you know what you are doing.

Misusing motor drivers can cause severe bodily injury or death.
