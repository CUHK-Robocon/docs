<Aside type="danger">
Regardless of whether you are a core or a new member, you **MUST** consult senior members if this is the first time you work with a VESC.

If you forgot any step, **DO NOT** attempt blindly, check the docs again.
If there are details unspecified in the docs, e.g. unseen buttons or pop-up warnings, ask someone who may know or make sure you know what you are doing.

Misusing motor drivers can cause severe bodily injury or death.

VESC (Vedder Electronic Speed Controller) is a family of open source and open hardware ESCs by Benjamin Vedder.

## Big Picture

![VESC 6 System Block Diagram](../../../assets/vesc-6-block.png)

Here is a simplified block diagram for a system with a single ESC.
Note that, the connections in the diagram do not correspond to physical cables, the setup will be a bit more complex in reality.

SBC is short for _Single-board Computer_, which is often Raspberry Pi in our case.
More about the SBC in other topics, we will be focusing on the purple region in the diagram for this topic.

The connections on the top of the VESC are for DC power input (red and grey) and control (orange).
The SBC controls the VESC & motor through CAN Bus, a reliable communication system commonly used in automobile and industrial applications.

<Aside type="note" title="Using a Power Supply">
In the diagram, the ESC is powered by a battery, which is what we will be doing in-game.
However, for testing purposes, it is advised to use a power supply for your safety.

From our experience, power supplies are less capable in handling transient currents than LiPo battery.
For mechanisms such as shooters, using a power supply may cause instability in performance or even random shutdowns.
